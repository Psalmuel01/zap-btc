🚀 One-Click Bitcoin Yield Shuttle

Track: Bitcoin Unleashed
Problem: Most BTC sits idle. Moving it into DeFi involves multiple high-friction steps.
Solution: A one-click app that accepts native BTC (L1 or Lightning), bridges it to Starknet, and deploys into a yield protocol automatically.

⸻

✨ Features
	•	Seamless Wallet Integration — Connect with Xverse Wallet for native BTC support.
	•	Cross-Chain Bridge — Powered by Atomiq SDK to convert BTC → WBTC on Starknet.
	•	Automatic Yield Deployment — Smart contracts written in Cairo route assets into:
	•	Troves / Endur yield vaults (aggregator option)
	•	Vesu lending pools (lending option)
	•	One-Click UX — Deposit BTC, see yield accrual instantly.

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	Frontend: React / Next.js
	•	Wallet: Xverse Wallet SDK
	•	Bridge: Atomiq SDK
	•	Smart Contracts: Cairo on Starknet
	•	Yield Protocols: Troves, Endur, Vesu

📐 Architecture Overview
	1.	User connects BTC wallet via Xverse.
	2.	User clicks “One-Click Shuttle.”
	3.	BTC bridges to Starknet WBTC via Atomiq SDK.
	4.	Smart contract auto-deposits into yield protocol.
	5.	User dashboard shows yield position + balance.

📋 Hackathon Roadmap
	•	Wallet connect with Xverse
	•	Frontend scaffold (React/Next.js)
	•	Atomiq bridge integration (mock if needed)
	•	Cairo contract: deposit, withdraw, get_user_position
	•	Connect frontend to Starknet contract
	•	Yield protocol integration (Troves or Vesu)
	•	Demo polish: landing page, fake APY chart

🎯 Potential Outcome

A seamless BTC → DeFi yield app that reduces onboarding friction to a single click.
Post-hackathon, this project could be extended into a production-ready protocol and is a strong candidate for a Starknet Foundation grant.
